Operators:

1. Arithmetic Operators

+	Addition
-	Substraction
*	Multiplication
/	Division
%	Modulo operator

2. Relational Operators (Numeric Comparison Operators):

-gt	-> greater than
-ge	-> greater than or equal to 
-lt	-> less than
-le	-> less than or equal to 
-eq	-> equal to
-ne	-> not equal to 

3. Logical operators (returns boolean values)

-a	-> logical AND
-o	-> logical OR
!	-> logical NOT

4. Assignment Operator

=
i++	-> increament operator
i--	-> decrement operator

How to perform mathematical operations?
There are multiple ways to perform.
1. by using 'expr' keyword
2. by using 'let' keyword
3. by using '(())' double parenthesis
4. by using '[]' square bracket.

1. by using expr keyword
-------------------------
expr means expression and it is a keyword.
echo "enter the value of a:" a
echo "enter the value of b:" b
sum=`expr $a + $b`		// space is mandatory before and after + symbol
sum=$(expr $a +$b)

Note: 
While using expr keyword, $ symbol is andatory.
Space is mandatory,before and after + symbol.
For equal symbol we should not give space.

2. by using let keyword
------------------------
echo "enter the value of a:" a
echo "enter the value of b:" b
let sum=$a+$b
echo "the sum:-$sum"

let sum=a+b
echo"the sum:$su"

Note:
While using let keyword, $ symbol is optional.
We should not give space befor and after + symbol.

3. by using double parenthesis (())
------------------------------------
echo "enter the value of a:" a
echo "enter the value of b:" b
sum=$(($a+$b))
sum=$((a+b))

echo"the sum:$sum"

both dolor and space symbol are optional.

4. by using square bracket[]
---------------------------
sum=$[a + b]
echo "the sum is $sum"
both dolar and space symbol are optional.

___________________________________
All these 4 approaches will work only for intergral arithmetic only(only for integers)
For floating point we need to use bc command.(binary calculator)

From terminal by using bc command.
$ bc
10.5+20.6	//31.1
10.2^2		//104.0
10+20		//30

bc command can work for both integral and floating point arithmetic.
ctrl+d 		// to come out of bc calculator.

Q. Script to perform floating point arithmetic:
-----------------------------------------------

read -p " enter 1st no: " a
read -p " enter 2nd no: " b

sum=$(echo $a +$b | bc)

echo "sum = $sum "

echo "the difference: $(echo $a-$b | bc)"
echo "the product: $(echo $a*$b | bc)"

Q.Write a script to read a 4 digit intiger no and print the sum of digits present in that number?

#! /bin/bash
read -p "Enter any 4-digit integer number: " n

a=$(echo $n | cut -c 1)
b=$(echo $n | cut -c 2)
c=$(echo $n | cut -c 3)
d=$(echo $n | cut -c 4)

sum=$[a+b+c+d]
echo "the sum of digits in $n is: $sum"


Q. Write a script to read employee monthly salary and print his bonus.
the bonus should be 25% of anual salary.

Monthly salary: 10000 
Annual salary: 120000
Bonus: 30000

#! /bin/bash

read -p "enter the salary: " salary
annual_salary=$[salary*12]
bonus=$[annual_salary*25/100]

echo " bonus is : $bonus "
